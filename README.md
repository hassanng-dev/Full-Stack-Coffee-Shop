I created a point of sale cafe application where employees are able to input a customer's order. Once a order is submitted the employee has the ability to sign in and see all orders that are pending. Once a order has been made the employee can click on the check button where the order will move to completed. Once the order is fulfilled an employee can delete the customer's order from their order's page.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. I used Javascript to grab information from the database that was submitted through the form I've created. I also used Javascript to be able to delete coffee. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
